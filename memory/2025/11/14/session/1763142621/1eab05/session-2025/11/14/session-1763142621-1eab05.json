In ERA we learn how to \"actually\" train LLMs from scratch. EAG focuses on Agents, and EPAi is a comprehensive course focusing on Python and programming for AI!\n    This comprehensive 20-session course equips students to build advanced Agentic AI systems, capable of autonomous decision-making, task orchestration, and seamless interaction within complex web environments. Unlike traditional AI programs, this curriculum focuses on designing browser-based agents that leverage the latest advancements in LLMs, retrieval-augmented systems, and multi-agent collaboration, preparing students to lead the development of next-generation AI solutions.\n    This course **does not teach** how to use langChain, langGraph, crew.ai or n8n! This course is about making such, and more advanced multi-model Agentic Frameworks and Agents on top of them.\n    The EAG course offers a revolutionary approach to learning AI, enabling students to design agents that mirror human-like intelligence in interacting with the web, bridging the gap between theory and application.\n    Registrations are closed now.
