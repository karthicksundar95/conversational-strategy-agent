As AI adoption has surged across industries, organizations face the significant challenge of controlling the total cost of ownership when operating multiple AI use-cases at scale. \\n\\nKey points covered include:\\n\\n1. **Cost Breakdown**: The costs of AI applications can be divided across the machine learning (ML) lifecycle stages, with inference costs typically becoming the dominant expense over time, especially for high-traffic applications.\\n\\n2. **Operational Costs**: Direct costs arise from compute and data storage, while indirect costs stem from engineering efforts to maintain production systems. A structured MLOps approach is recommended to optimize these costs and improve business value.\\n\\n3. **Cost Drivers**: When deploying AI, teams must define requirements such as latency, throughput, and cost limitations, which may involve trade-offs.
