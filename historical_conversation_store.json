The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_1]\",\n        \"DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\",\n        \"Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi are / were promoter Directors.|Yes| |8.|Gensol Ventures Private Limited|Part of the promoter group of Gensol|Yes| |9.|Gensol EV Lease Private Limited|Subsidiary(Gensol held 88.21% of the company)|Yes| ***Loan for Rs. 71.41 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 3 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 31.

On the same day, the Company transferred promoter contribution of Rs. 26.06 Crore from another internal account into the above Trust and Retention Account. The total funds credited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. 33. On October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and Retention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. 0.79 Crore. It was noted that immediately upon receipt of the said amount, Go-Auto, on the same day, transferred Rs. 50 Crore to Capbridge (Bank A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), a disclosed related party of Gensol. The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias. The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias. (b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the consideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. (c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. (d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge. (e) The advance of Rs. 5 Crore was returned to Jasminder Kaur by DLF on November 21, 2022. 35.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financing. 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29.

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\",\n        \"Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi are / were promoter Directors.|Yes| |8.|Gensol Ventures Private Limited|Part of the promoter group of Gensol|Yes| |9.|Gensol EV Lease Private Limited|Subsidiary(Gensol held 88.21% of the company)|Yes| ***Loan for Rs. 71.41 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 3 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 31.

The total funds credited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. 33. On October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and Retention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. 0.79 Crore.

The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias. The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias. (b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the consideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financing. 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29.

Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this\\n[Source: dlf.md, ID: dlf_0]\",\n        \"Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi are / were promoter Directors.|Yes| |8.|Gensol Ventures Private Limited|Part of the promoter group of Gensol|Yes| |9.|Gensol EV Lease Private Limited|Subsidiary(Gensol held 88.21% of the company)|Yes| ***Loan for Rs. 71.41 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 3 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 31.

On the same day, the Company transferred promoter contribution of Rs. 26.06 Crore from another internal account into the above Trust and Retention Account. The total funds credited in the said account amounted to Rs. 97.46 Crore. 33. On October 03, 2022, Rs. 93.88 Crore was transferred from the Trust and Retention Account to Go-Auto (Bank A/c No. 06792000003065 with HDFC Bank). Prior to this transfer, the balance in the said account of Go-Auto was Rs. 0.79 Crore. It was noted that immediately upon receipt of the said amount, Go-Auto, on the same day, transferred Rs. 50 Crore to Capbridge (Bank A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), a disclosed related party of Gensol. The Capbridge account had a balance of Rs. 0.15 Crore prior to this transaction. 34. On October 06, 2022, it was noted that Capbridge transferred Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF Limited (DLF). As per information provided by DLF (email dated December 17, 2024), the above payment was made towards consideration for the purchase of an apartment in the project The Camellias. The submissions made by DLF Ltd. are summarised below: (a) On September 29, 2022, a sum of Rs. 5 Crore was paid to DLF by Jasminder Kaur, as advance, for booking an apartment in the project The Camellias. (b) On October 06, 2022, Capbridge paid Rs. 42.94 Crore to DLF as part of the consideration for the above apartment booked by Jasminder Kaur. (c) On October 20, 2022, the allotment was formally made to Jasminder Kaur. (d) Thereafter, on request, the allotment was substituted in favour of Capbridge. (e) The advance of Rs. 5 Crore was returned to Jasminder Kaur by DLF on November 21, 2022. 35.

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has passed since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financing. 28.

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \\u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt.

We will start from the very basics and work our way towards more advanced topics. Even if you have almost no prior programming and/or mathematics knowledge, you should be able to follow along pretty smoothly.\n    \n    The first mini-series will be split into four parts:\n    \n    - Part 1: What is Reinforcement learning?\n    - Part 2: RL terminology and formal concepts\n    - Part 3: The REINFORCE algorithm\n    - Part 4: Implementing the REINFORCE algorithm\n    \n    At the same time, this mini-series will be the introduction to future posts with increasing complexity. Feel free to skip to the next part if you are already familiar with the content.\n    \n    ## That sounds cool! \u2026 but what can I do with RL?\n    \n    Reinforcement learning is a framework to learn any task. In theory, RL can solve any problem that is phrased as a Markov Decision Process. We will explain what that means later on. For now, let\u2019s have a look at some successful applications. If you enjoy these examples, please be sure to also check out the work from the original authors.\n    \n    ### General\n    \n    One of the videos I love showing is the hide and seek video from OpenAI. The video is a nice example of how RL can help us with finding novel solutions to problems, without explicitly programming tactics or solution methods.\n    \n    ### Games\n    \n    One of the early successes of Deep RL (which is combining RL with neural networks), was the ability to learn how to play Atari games, straight from pixels. Later on, researchers took it upon themselves to not only evaluate RL on the (relatively) simple Atari games, but rather evaluate it on the hardest competitive games out there. The assumption here is, that if RL can solve these complex games, it can also generalize to challenging real-world settings. As an example, this is Deepmind\u2019s AlphaStar taking on a pro-gamer in the game StarCraft 2.\n    \n    ### Robotics\n    \n    Solving tasks in simulations and video games is one thing, but what about real life? Another popular field where RL is often applied (or at least holds great promise), is robotics. Robotics are significantly harder than simulations for various reasons. Think for example about the time it takes to repeatedly make a robot try out a certain action. Or think about the safety requirements involved for robotics. In the example below, you can see how the ANYmal robot from the Robotics System Lab in Z\u00fcrich learned to recover from a fall.\n    \n    ### Real world examples\n    \n    RL can be applied to many other domains than the ones I just mentioned. Advertising, finance, healthcare, \u2026 just to name a few. As a final example, I present a goal-oriented chatbot, trained to negotiate about sales.\n    \n    ## RL: The basics\n    \n    A description of the RL framework is as follows: We have an agent that tries to solve a task in a certain environment. The concept of agent should be taken very broadly here, an agent can be a robot, a chatbot, a virtual character, etc. . At every timestep *t*, the agent needs to choose an action *a*. After this action it might receive a reward *r* and we get a new observation of its state *s*. The new state can be determined both by the action of the agent and also by the environment the agent is operating in.\n    \n    The RL problem is trying to maximize the cumulative reward the agent gets over time.\n    \n    Imagine our **agent **is a monkey and the task we want the monkey to solve, is to pick up as many bananas as possible. **At every timestep**, the monkey needs to decide to **take an action**. The actions could be to step towards the tree, grab something, climb, \u2026 Perhaps the **reward **at every timestep can be defined as the number of bananas the monkey got at that timestep. After every action, the monkey will also be in a new **state**. Maybe we define the state of the monkey as its position in the world. So when the monkey takes a step, the state at the next timestep would be the coordinates of the monkey at the next timestep. We are now searching for the **optimal behavior, the best sequence of actions the monkey can take**, to maximize the cumulative number of bananas it will get.\n    \n    ## How does RL fit in the bigger picture?\n    \n    You might look at this framework and think:* \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that exactly what people are already studying in the field of \u2026?\u201d*. And in fact, you might be right.\n    \n    In other domains like engineering or mathematics, people have often been studying the same problems with different names and methods. Or in fields like neuroscience and psychology, some similarities can be found in the way our brain \u201crewards\u201d us by releasing dopamine.\n    \n    The likely reason for this intersection of domains, is that reinforcement learning is the study of a fundamental problem. **It is essentially the science of decision taking. **In these series, we will be looking at it from the umbrella of computer science and machine learning.\n    \n    This general applicability is also what makes RL so interesting to me personally. RL is one of the potential technologies that could get us closer to general AI: an AI system that can solve any task, in contrast to a narrow set of tasks. There are also other technologies (e.g. big language models, graph neural networks, \u2026) that are making some strides in this regard, but the problem statement of RL in particular seems to be the most ambitious.\n    \n    Another way of situating RL, is by looking at how it compares to other learning paradigms. Within the field of machine learning, people often distinguish between **Supervised learning**, **Unsupervised learning** and **Reinforcement learning**.\n    \n    When it comes to **Supervised learning**, we are essentially trying to learn a function, a mapping from X to Y. Our dataset consists of samples X and during training we provide the AI system with labels Y of what these samples should map to. Our AI model is successful when it correctly predicts a label y given an (unseen) sample x.\n    \n    As an example, say we have a dataset consisting of cat and dog images. Each sample (image) has a label, stating whether the image contains a \u201cdog\u201d or a \u201ccat\u201d. The goal of our supervised model, is now to learn how to map a dog-image to the label \u201cdog\u201d and a cat-image to the label \u201ccat\u201d. After it has learned this mapping, the hope is that this AI model can repeat this process for new images that it has not seen before.\n    \n    In an **Unsupervised learning** context, we no longer provide any labels Y. So the task for the AI system now becomes learning some general statistics about the dataset. We could for example give an AI the task to generate a new sample, similar to the ones seen in the dataset. In this case the model would be considered successful if it manages to correctly learn the interesting characteristics of a dataset.\n    \n    **Reinforcement Learning** is rather different from the previous paradigms. In the case of RL, we consider an agent that is actively interacting with an environment. Through its interactions, it is possible that it may influence the environment that it operates in. The \u201cdataset\u201d we need to consider here, are the actions our agent took and the accumulated rewards it got by taking those actions. An added difficulty here is that our dataset is non-static. Say that our agent acts in a certain way, we can then collect some data of the actions our agent took and we can try to optimize these (e.g. do more of the actions that led to a successful result). But as a result of this optimization, we have now changed the behavior of this agent, and thus we will need to collect new data to see how well our agent fares now.\n    \n    ## If RL is so great, then why isn\u2019t everyone using RL?\n    \n    After reading all this, you might be wondering why people aren\u2019t using RL to solve all imaginable problems. The truth is that even though the field has made a lot of advancements in the last few years, there are still a few fundamental problems to be solved. Progress is being made all the time, but to give you an idea of what you might encounter, I\u2019ll list a few common ones.\n    \n    ### Sample (in-)efficiency\n    \n    It is generally known that RL is very sample-inefficient. We regard a \u201csample\u201d as an interaction with the environment. RL needs a lot of samples/interactions to be able to solve a task. In this sense, RL is very inefficient compared to humans, for example, it doesn\u2019t take a human dozens of hours to learn how to play an Atari game.\n    \n    This sample-efficiency can in part be explained by the fact that humans can leverage a lot of their previous knowledge (priors) when they encounter a new task. A human can for example reuse some of the knowledge and skills of previous games and/or concepts they already acquired from other experiences throughout their life. An RL-agent in contrast, starts the learning process without any assumptions.\n    \n    Another thing to mention is that leveraging knowledge from previous tasks is also an active research topic. I\u2019ll just put one example (out of many) here to give you an idea.\n    \n    ### The exploration-exploitation trade-off\n    \n    While the previous problem sounds more like an engineering effort (it\u2019s not), the exploration-exploitation trade-off seems more fundamental. Whenever we train an RL-agent, the agent will need some time to explore, it needs to take some actions that it hasn\u2019t taken before, in order to discover how to solve the problem. On the other hand, we can\u2019t let the agent always take random actions, because these random actions might lead to nothing. Sometimes we want the agent to leverage what it has already learned to try and optimize further. This is the exploration-exploitation trade-off, we want an automated way to strike a good balance between letting the agent explore and taking actions for which it already knows what they will lead to.\n    \n    For a lot problems, it is quite possible that the agent gets stuck in a local optimum.\n    \n    The exploration-exploitation trade-off sounds very much tractable at first, but it turns out to be one of the hardest problems for RL to solve. To give you an idea about how hard this problem is: The problem was originally considered by the scientists of the allied forces, but was suggested to be dropped over to Germany, because it was deemed so intractable that they wanted the German scientists to also waste their time on it.\n    \n    No silver bullet for this problem has been found and there are many people working on various solutions. I will leave a link here to a previously proposed solution called \u201ccuriosity-driven exploration\u201d which I found particularly interesting.\n    \n    ### The sparse-reward problem\n    \n    Another rather fundamental problem, is the so called Sparse-reward problem. As the name implies, this problem occurs when our RL-agent receives so little rewards, that it actually gets no feedback on how it should improve.\n    \n    Imagine for example this mountain car. The agent needs to move the car left and right, such that it gets enough momentum to reach the top. Initially though, the agent doesn\u2019t know that it needs to move the car back and forth to reach the top. If we only give our agent a reward (a positive feedback signal) when we have reached the flag, it might not ever get a positive feedback signal, simply because it might never reach the flag by taking random actions (exploration).\n    \n    Something commonly done to counteract this problem, is by \u201creward shaping\u201d. We will modify the reward such that the agent gets more feedback signals to learn from. In case of the mountain car, we could for example also give the agent a positive reward based on the speed or altitude it achieves. However, reward shaping is not a scalable solution. Luckily other solutions are being sought after.\n    \n    The aforementioned problems are just some prominent examples, but there are in fact many more problems that are being looked into by some of the brightest minds out there. The good news is that regular and steady progress is being made.\n    \n    ## Conclusion\n    \n    Phew, that was a lot of information in a very short period, but you made it through! This first introduction should give you a good idea of what RL is all about.\n    \n    In the next article, we will start formalizing some of the ideas and concepts which we have briefly touched upon in this post, as a preparation for getting our hands dirty and implementing these ideas ourselves.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analyze the provided content and summarize\n    summary = \"\"\"\n    This article serves as the first part of a series introducing Reinforcement Learning (RL), a framework for training AI models to achieve specific goals. It outlines the structure of the series, which includes an overview of RL, key terminology, the REINFORCE algorithm, and its implementation.\n\n    The article discusses various applications of RL, including its success in games like Atari and StarCraft 2, as well as in robotics and real-world scenarios like advertising and healthcare. It introduces the basic concepts of RL, explaining the roles of agents, actions, rewards, and states in maximizing cumulative rewards.\n\n    The article also addresses challenges in RL, such as sample inefficiency, the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and sparse-reward problems, highlighting ongoing research to resolve these issues. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of RL in the pursuit of general AI and sets the stage for further exploration in subsequent articles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    return f\"FINAL_ANSWER: {summary.strip()}\""

This position is corroborated by Go-Auto Private Limited (Go-Auto), the stated supplier of the EVs, which confirmed that it sold 4,704 EVs to the Company for a total consideration of Rs. 567.73 Crore. 27. However, records show that the company received loans aggregating Rs. 663.89 Crore for the stated purpose from IREDA and PFC. Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \\u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30. For ease of reference, the details of the related parties to which fund transfers were observed from Go-Auto are detailed in the Table below, before explaining the nature of transactions entered with these entities. |Sl.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz. Matrix Gas and Renewables Ltd. (Matrix). The fund flow, as per the bank statements, is shown below: ***Movement of funds from Gensol to DLF Limited while booking apartment*** **Image:** Gensol 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 050860500165 Welray 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 0508605002357 Anmol Jaggi 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasmin Kaur 29/09/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DLF Limited ***Movement of funds, after DLF returned the funds to Ms. Jasminder Kaur*** **Image:** Matrix Gas 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002354 Welfare 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 056605002357 Anmol Jaggi 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520339 Jasminder Kaur 14/12/2022 ICICI Bank 004301520338 DFL Limited ### **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 11 of 29** ----- ### 38. Bank statements of Capbridge Ventures LLP further showed that it received Rs. 70 Crore in FY 2023 from Go-Auto: Rs. 50 Crore on October 03, 2022 which was partly utilized for acquiring the apartment in The Camellias, DLF; and another Rs. 20 Crore on December 31, 2022, which prima facie appears to be diverted from the funds transferred to Go-Auto from the proceeds of Loan amounting to Rs. 71.41 Crore availed by Gensol from IREDA ( Loan at Sl. No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt. Ltd. (Blu-Smart\\u201d) from its Bank Account No. 68230000001712 with Bandhan Bank. The source of these funds and transactions need further examination. ***Loan for Rs. 43.69 Crore from IREDA (Serial No. 6 in the Table under Para 24)*** ### 40. The disclosure made by Gensol in its annual report for FY 2022-23, w.r.t. this loan is given below: **Image:** Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) Rs.43,69,000/- carries\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_7]\", \"Gensol EV Lease in FY 2024).

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \\u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt. Ltd.*** ### 58. As stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money borrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto.\\n[Source: INVG67564.pdf, ID: INVG67564_21]\", \"the account stood at Rs. 146.84 Crore. 47. On September 29, 2023, the Company transferred Rs. 134.14 Crore from the above ICICI Bank Account to another bank account of Gensol viz. Gensol Engineering Limited\\u2013PFC\\u2013Construction Contract Expense Account having Account No. 058605004917 with ICICI Bank. On the same day, Gensol from the said bank account transferred funds of Rs. 134.14 Crore to Go-Auto (ICICI Bank A/c No. 103705000861). The balance in Go-Auto\\u2019s account prior to this transaction was Rs. 0.19 Crore. Immediately upon receipt of these funds **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 14 of 29** ----- ### (September 29, 2023), Go-Auto transferred Rs. 96.69 Crore to the following entities: (a) Rs. 46.65 Crore was transferred to Gensol Consultant Pvt. Ltd. (Axis bank A/c No. 921020036427118), which had a prior balance of Rs. 5.07 Lakh (b) Rs. 50.04 Crore was transferred to Capbridge Ventures LLP (A/c No. 920020064107731 with Axis Bank), which had a balance of Rs. 97,209 before the transaction. On the same date, Capbridge transferred Rs. 40 Crore to Gensol Ventures Pvt. Ltd. (A/c No. 058605500770 with ICICI Bank), which had a debit balance of Rs. 38.12 Crore prior to this transaction. 48. Based on the fund trail and account balances, it is prima facie observed that Rs. 96.69 Crore was diverted to promoter and promoter-linked entities, bypassing the stated end-use of the PFC loan. 49. A pictorial representation of the above movement of funds is given below: **Image:** Rs 46.65 crore 29/09/2023 Rs 134.14 crore 29/09/2023 Gensol Consultant Private Limited Gensol Venture Private Limited Capbridge Ventures LLP Gensol Venture Private Limited Rs 50.04 crore 29/09/2023 50. Further, it was noted that Capbridge had transferred funds back to Go-Auto, through circular movement of funds which originated from Go-Auto, itself. It was noted that an amount of Rs. 10 Crore was circulated four times by Go-Auto itself through Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd. and Go-Solar Venture Private Limited on 04/01/2024.

href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> [1]</a>. This growth has translated into a surge of AI use-cases reaching production, where in the last two years, the number of use-cases deployed per company more than doubled<a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/survey-generative-ai-uptake-is-unprecedented-despite-roadblocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> [2]</a>. This growth has exposed new challenges for companies that are deploying and scaling more AI than ever, notably how to control and reduce total cost of ownership when operating many AI use-cases in production at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1c315b89f97726dc5a860e66c74a855d\">The cost of developing, deploying, and scaling AI applications can be broken down based on the different stages of the ML lifecycle, from ideation and training to building, deployment, and scaling. Generally, for AI applications that will receive high levels of traffic (&gt;100s of requests per second on average), ongoing costs of inference outweigh training costs over time. This is because training is often executed discretely with the aim of producing increasingly performant models, whereas inference costs are incurred on an ongoing basis and scale based on usage over time. Several sources, including Amazon and NVIDIA, estimate that <em>\u201cinference accounts for up to 90% of the machine learning costs for high-scale deployed AI systems</em>\u201d<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210537923000124\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> [3]</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blog_trainging-Graph-1024x768.png\" alt=\"Training Vs.

Additionally, creating a comprehensive MLOps framework supports financial goals indirectly by facilitating the development of applications with a wide variety of business use-cases. In other words, a considered approach to MLOps can help maximize the business value captured by AI by providing an efficient process by which to iterate on AI applications and maintain uptime, for example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c95ee71c24a0310196c6792073402aa2\">Let\u2019s explore how to reduce direct costs in the deployment, scaling, and management (in production) part of the ML lifecycle. We will explore the key cost drivers and share practical optimizations that can help teams run and maintain AI applications and inference at scale in production systems as efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:58px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cost Drivers in AI Deployment and Inference</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:31px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Defining Requirements</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-32656bb95aa9b959c4a62017124be9a4\">Once a Data Scientist or ML engineer has created a model that performs well for its intended use-case, the process of integrating that model into a production-ready system can start. At this point, various aspects of production deployment and their trade-offs should be considered:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-30a5c6e8a2d766441f770daac3bf1a73\"><strong>Latency and Throughput</strong>: how quickly do responses need to be returned?</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bfc22cb343600f501274c309876a5ba4\"><strong>Traffic</strong>: how many requests will the system need to handle over time?</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-49ee2cdd582d5326b59a7f4d50c0afd4\"><strong>Cost limitations</strong>: what is an acceptable cost profile for operating AI use-cases?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-709d4913c06f90f87cab58059220b01e\">These aspects will have trade-offs against each other. For example, use-cases that require especially low latency might necessitate more expensive compute infrastructure, like GPUs (or even TPUs) as opposed to only CPUs. GPUs and CPUs can also vary in their own performance profiles and cost across machine types.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7275bc611826f19d64cb33081da48ce3\">It is best practice to first define the most important requirements of a given business use-case (e.g., latency, throughput, etc.), and then optimize the implementation of that use-case such that those requirements are still met. For example, latency and throughput needs can be assessed first, as well as the magnitude of traffic the system will experience, before designing the implementation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-570a028db8143f0d9d102aa8b30e4feb\">In cases where many applications are to be put into production, it is important to also consider that applications can be hosted on shared infrastructure in order to consolidate costs as much as possible across use-cases. This is something Seldon Core 2 offers in the form of Multi-Model serving, where multiple models use shared inference servers and underlying infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17970\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reducing Cost in Operationalizing AI</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:34px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Models</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7d4e5198b041b11ef97f8e33a13e736f\">When it comes to reducing the cost of deploying and running AI in production, efficient model serving can be prepared before even considering production infrastructure. Model-level cost optimization focuses on making models smaller, faster, and more efficient without sacrificing the output quality needed for a given business use-case.The following techniques can reduce the memory and compute footprint of individual models:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-aed2010b83f4f07ddd54e1372db3a8d0\"><strong>Quantization</strong> cuts compute and memory needs by lowering number precision for model weights and activations (e.g., from float32 to int8 or fp16)</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9a5ddc978398a2eb169299d6ba0aeab9\"><strong>Pruning</strong> reduces model size and speeds up execution without impacting performance by removing low-impact weights or neurons</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b8db965e0ca0515f4a11086ebe2cd9ad\"><strong>Knowledge Distillation</strong> trains smaller models to replicate a larger models\u2019 behavior, keeping most of the performance at a fraction of the cost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-70a1a4a8d732b40d1cc177844217fd73\">If multiple model implementations are considered, dynamic model routing lets systems direct requests to different models, only using larger, more complex implementations when required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5f1a28b4a1166a3feef5a5fafb54e9b3\">By leveraging any of the optimizations above, latency and throughput requirements can be met with less expensive hardware, and cost can be saved by reducing or releasing provisioned hardware based on the needs of the underlying models.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Inference</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ac1394a7908f47377007a087868e9efa\">Once a model artifact is ready, the way in which inference is executed is another area where efficiency improvements can be explored. There are several options there that can reduce costs while maintaining performance. For example, if there is some latency leeway,<a href=\"https://docs.seldon.ai/mlserver/user-guide/adaptive-batching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> dynamic or adaptive batching</a> can help capture some of the efficiency benefits of batch processing while still meeting real-time or near-real-time latency. Using this technique, the inference serving system collects incoming requests for a short, configurable time window (often just a few milliseconds) and batches as many as possible before sending them to the model. Many serving frameworks like&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/solutions/seldon-mlserver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Seldon\u2019s MLServer</strong></a> or <strong>Triton Inference Server</strong> offer dynamic or adaptive batching.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-1-1-1024x583.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17976\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-19857062706ee2dcb12bbfb6f46e2ada\">There are many other inference techniques to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b007d5e57f185ad6b4818a79a1630b70\"><strong>Caching</strong> results avoids unnecessary re-computation when a use-cases\u2019 outputs repeat or change infrequently.

For use-cases that require even higher throughput than traditional setups, more specialized inference accelerators (e.g., NVIDIA TensorRT, AWS Inferentia) are tuned for throughput at scale; however, these only support specific models types and architectures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Low-latency applications</strong>, like chatbots or real-time decisioning systems, typically benefit from low memory and interconnect latency, which favor GPUs with low startup and kernel launch latency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8ac672fea5606d5a7bf6de21fb641f4a\"><strong>Multi-modal or large model use-cases</strong>, like vision-language models, or LLMs with &gt;7B parameters, require large memory capacity (e.g. &gt;80GB GPU VRAM) to avoid tensor offloading. These use-cases benefit from high-speed interconnects (NVLink, PCIe 5.0) for tensor parallelism or pipeline parallelism across multiple GPUs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ad44837dbbc61de23f23d4c1a53cc5fe\">Some public benchmarks are available that assess the performance of different CPU and GPU setups on some common workload types (see<a href=\"https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/inference-datacenter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> MLPerf Inference benchmarks</a>). However, there is no substitute for in-house benchmarking when it comes to assessing the right hardware for specific models and needs. To do this, users can set up a benchmarking framework to measure latency (usually by P50, P95, and P99 percentiles), throughput, and memory usage in scenarios that are representative of usage in production.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scaling</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-08f65cad2ef0e4e0ac0aefbe4779a0df\">When deploying AI applications, it is important to understand how the workloads that the application will need to support will change dynamically over time in order to ensure the system can support business requirements as those workloads change. Real-time applications can vary widely in the magnitude of incoming requests at any given time, potentially even in the timespan of seconds or minutes. Understanding load patterns helps right-size the infrastructure needed to support business requirements, whether they are requirements around latency, throughput, or resource utilization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-16bbb34e66e46b8f60e970a26ad10229\">When traffic varies over time, implementing scaling logic on the infrastructure side is key to ensuring that just the right amount of resources needed (i.e., memory and compute) are used. Without scaling logic implemented, users often over-provision resources to guarantee performance metrics are met. This, however, leads to wasted resources (and associated costs) when traffic is not at its peak. In CAST AI\u2019s most recent analysis, for companies with Kubernetes clusters using more than 50 CPUs, \u201c<em>only 10 percent of provisioned CPUs and 23 percent of Memory is utilized\u201c</em><a href=\"https://cast.ai/press-release/cast-ai-analysis-finds-only-13-percent-of-provisioned-cpus-and-20-percent-of-memory-is-utilized/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>[4]</em></a><em>.</em> For companies paying up to millions per month in infrastructure costs, this represents significant potential for cost savings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18009\" srcset=\"https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-300x225.png 300w, https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-768x576.png 768w, https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-2048x1536.png 2048w, https://www.seldon.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Blue-White-Modern-Line-Chart-Graph-4-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ecb535b93d991d3476454732ce4bc9bf\">Setting up autoscaling logic allows users to target specific metrics that would automatically trigger scale-up and down events, whereby the components of an application are scaled horizontally. Usually, those metrics are based on performance metrics like latency (aggregated over a certain number of requests) or resource usage like CPU or Memory Utilization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9f5d8b90eed2088ea518e45fb64a9561\">The way this is implemented depends on the higher-level approach taken to infrastructure orchestration, which generally offers support for scaling logic, as well as rolling updates, service discovery, and fault tolerance. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, offering this functionality for large enterprise use. As of 2024, over 60% of enterprises have adopted Kubernetes in production environments, with projections suggesting adoption could exceed 90% by 2027<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Managing-Realtime-AI-Cost-in-Production-A-Practical-Guide-22b6a4c8852080c2a248f14ce196ec57?pvs=21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> [5]</a>. If using Kubernetes, common approaches to setting up autoscaling include<a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> (HPA) or<a href=\"https://keda.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> KEDA</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Monitoring and Cost Governance</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A robust MLOps strategy requires an approach to understanding and managing costs. To support this, centralized AI teams generally implement a dedicated system for monitoring and governance. This way, teams are able to track compute usage in detail (e.g., GPU/CPU hours, memory footprint, request volume, and model response times) with attribution across teams, projects, and/or environments. Cloud-native observability stacks (for example, Prometheus and Grafana) can be extended to record cost metadata alongside performance metrics, while FinOps tools like AWS Cost Explorer or GCP Billing with label-based cost allocation provide a clear breakdown of spend per deployment for cloud implementations. By combining these data streams, teams can set budgets for each production model and configure automated alerts when request volumes or runtime costs spike unexpectedly, helping catch runaway usage early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this visibility in place, the next step is implementing automated cost controls directly in the serving and scaling infrastructure. Quotas can cap the maximum concurrent requests or scale-out instances a model can use, preventing runaway autoscaling during traffic surges. Alerts can feed into operational workflows (e.g., routing to cheaper implementations when costs spike). Fallback strategies may include routing non-critical traffic to batch-processing queues or caching common responses to reduce inference calls. Integrating these policies into the CI/CD pipeline ensures every model deployment is evaluated for both performance and cost efficiency before going live, if performance regression tests are expanded to include cost regression checks. This closed-loop approach ensures live operations are governed not just by latency SLAs but also by total cost of ownership, keeping production AI both responsive and economically sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b43188cd811581e53f6c9d83742b45fd\">Cost-Efficient AI with <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/solutions/core/\">Seldon Core 2</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:37px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a68f8c5d30ed8a6b1fae7ae7dca5fd13\">As AI adoption continues to accelerate, addressing the cost challenges of running production AI systems is emerging as a critical priority for organizations running AI at scale.

    "final_answer": "The article from Seldon.io discusses the challenges and strategies for managing the costs associated with deploying AI in production environments. As AI adoption has surged across industries, organizations face the significant challenge of controlling the total cost of ownership when operating multiple AI use-cases at scale. \n\nKey points covered include:\n\n1. **Cost Breakdown**: The costs of AI applications can be divided across the machine learning (ML) lifecycle stages, with inference costs typically becoming the dominant expense over time, especially for high-traffic applications.\n\n2. **Operational Costs**: Direct costs arise from compute and data storage, while indirect costs stem from engineering efforts to maintain production systems. A structured MLOps approach is recommended to optimize these costs and improve business value.\n\n3. **Cost Drivers**: When deploying AI, teams must define requirements such as latency, throughput, and cost limitations, which may involve trade-offs. Consolidating applications on shared infrastructure can also help manage costs.\n\n4. **Model Optimization**: Techniques like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation can make models more efficient without compromising performance. Dynamic model routing can also help in utilizing resources effectively.\n\n5. **Efficient Inference Execution**: Strategies such as dynamic batching, caching, and using optimized runtimes can decrease costs while maintaining performance.\n\n6. **Hardware Selection**: Choosing the right hardware based on workload requirements is crucial. Benchmarking different hardware options helps in identifying the best performance-to-cost ratio.\n\n7. **Scaling**: Implementing autoscaling allows organizations to adjust resources dynamically based on real-time traffic patterns, helping avoid over-provisioning and associated costs.\n\n8. **Monitoring and Governance**: A robust MLOps strategy includes monitoring usage and costs through dedicated systems, enabling teams to set budgets and implement automated cost controls to prevent unexpected spikes in expenditure.\n\n9. **Seldon Core 2**: The article positions Seldon Core 2 as a solution to these challenges, offering features that allow for efficient deployment, dynamic resource management, and integrated cost monitoring, ultimately enabling organizations to scale AI effectively without incurring excessive costs.\n\nIn summary, organizations can manage AI costs effectively through careful planning, optimization techniques, and leveraging tools like Seldon Core 2 to streamline operations and maintain financial control.",

    "final_answer": "Virat Kohli and Rahul Dravid are two of India's greatest cricketers, each having made significant contributions to the game in different eras and formats, particularly in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Test cricket. Here\u2019s a comprehensive comparison based on the available content:\n\n### ODI Comparison\n1. **Runs and Average**:\n   - As of their respective career statistics after 305 ODIs, Virat Kohli has scored an impressive 14,255 runs at an average of 57.71 with a strike rate of 93.26. This places him among the highest run-scorers in ODIs with a phenomenal average, indicative of his aggressive batting style.\n   - In contrast, Rahul Dravid, known for his technique and composure, has a different statistical profile. While exact numbers from the provided content aren't detailed for Dravid, he is historically recognized for his reliability and consistency as a top-order batsman in ODIs.\n\n2. **Centuries**:\n   - Kohli has amassed numerous centuries in ODIs, which is a testament to his ability to convert starts into big scores. His aggressive yet calculated approach has made him a match-winner for India.\n   - Dravid, often referred to as \"The Wall,\" also has a significant number of centuries, but his style was more about building partnerships and anchoring the innings rather than explosive scoring.\n\n### Test Comparison\n1. **Performance in SENA Nations**:\n   - Kohli has recorded 12 Test centuries in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) nations, showcasing his ability to adapt and perform in challenging conditions, which is vital for a batsman\u2019s legacy.\n   - Dravid, known for his prowess in Test cricket, also performed exceptionally in these conditions, often playing crucial innings under pressure. However, specific stats for Dravid in SENA nations were not detailed in the provided content.\n\n2. **Overall Impact**:\n   - Kohli's aggressive batting and ability to chase down targets have redefined ODI cricket strategy, whereas Dravid\u2019s technique and temperament have set benchmarks for future generations in Test cricket.\n   - Kohli is often celebrated for his modern approach to batting, while Dravid is revered for his classical technique and mental fortitude.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile both players have left an indelible mark on cricket, their styles and contributions reflect the evolution of the game.

    "final_answer": "The article \"Attention Is All You Need: A Complete Guide to Transformers\" provides an in-depth examination of transformer models, which have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). The key elements highlighted in the article include:\n\n1. **Introduction to Transformers**: Transformers utilize an attention mechanism to weigh different parts of an input sequence, enabling better understanding and processing of context. This architecture allows for parallel processing, making it more efficient than traditional sequential models like RNNs and LSTMs.\n\n2. **Model Architecture**: The transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder processes input data into a mapped representation, while the decoder generates the output sequence through an auto-regressive process, where each output depends on previous ones.\n\n3. **Encoder and Decoder Details**:\n   - The encoder is made up of stacked layers that include multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks, employing residual connections and layer normalization for stability.\n   - The decoder adds a third layer for cross-attention, allowing it to reference the encoder's outputs while ensuring it remains auto-regressive through a masking mechanism.\n\n4. **Attention Mechanism**: The foundation of the transformer is its attention mechanism, particularly self-attention, which evaluates the importance of different elements in an input sequence. The article explains how queries, keys, and values are derived and compared to produce attention weights that inform the model of which parts of the input to focus on.\n\n5. **Multi-Head Attention**: This extends the attention mechanism by allowing multiple attention heads to process the input in parallel, capturing diverse aspects and relationships within the data.\n\n6. **Feed-Forward Networks and Layer Normalization**: After attention computations, a fully connected feed-forward network processes each position independently, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns. Layer normalization is applied to stabilize outputs and improve training efficiency.\n\n7. **Positional Encoding**: Since transformers do not inherently understand the order of input sequences, positional encoding is added to embeddings to convey the position of tokens, ensuring the model can discern meaning based on word order.\n\n8. **Overall Functionality**: The transformer model excels at sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation and text summarization, by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and relationships within data. The ultimate goal is to produce outputs through probabilities, predicting the likelihood of each token in the generated sequence.\n\nIn summary, the article outlines the transformative impact of the transformer architecture in AI, detailing its components and mechanisms that allow it to outperform traditional models in various NLP tasks.",
